# How to use MyRocks in existing system

This document is guided by this guideline (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/getting-started-with-myrocks/)
1. install all dependency by ‘apt’

```
sudo apt-get install mariadb-plugin-rocksdb
```
2. install the plugin (if your server is running)

```
INSTALL SONAME 'ha_rocksdb';
```
3. install the plugin from server options ( need restart the mysql server)

create the following entry in my.cnf or other option files, 

```
[mariadb]
plugin_load_add = ha_rocksdb
```

if you install the plugin from apt, this step can be skipped

4. to verify your installation

connect to the mysql server by 

`sudo mysql -u root`

then use command `SHOW PLUGINS;` to check whether rocksdb is in there or not
